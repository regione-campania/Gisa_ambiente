<briefDescription>This is the &amp;quot;Home Page&amp;quot;. The top set of tabs shows the individual modules that you can access. The second row are the functions available to you in this module.
If you are looking for a particular module or function you have seen during training or on someone else's machine, and it's NOT visible, then it probably means that you do not have permission for that module or function.

Permissions within the system are assigned to Roles and then Users are assigned to Roles by the System Administrator.</briefDescription>
<detailDescription>The Home Page has several main features.

Welcome: This is the welcome page. Here you will see a calendar of all of your upcoming alerts in the system, as well as for users that report to you.

Mailbox: The message system is designed to support INTERNAL business messaging needs and to prepare OUTGOING emails to addresses who are already in the system. Messaging is NOT a normal email replacement. It will not send email to addresses assigned &amp;quot;on-the-fly&amp;quot; and it will not receive OUTSIDE email.

Tasks: Tasks allows you to create and assign tasks. Tasks created can be assigned to the creator of the task or an employee working in the system. This page lists the tasks present along with their priorities, due dates and age.

Action Lists: Action Lists allow you to create a list of contacts that are related in some way. For each of the contacts in a list, you can add calls, opportunities, tickets, tasks or send a message, which would correspondingly show up in their respective tabs. For example, adding a ticket to the contact would be reflected in the Ticket module.

Re-assignments: You can reassign data from one employee to another employee as long as each employee reports to you. The data can be of different types related to accounts, contacts, opportunities, activities, tickets etc, which the newly reassigned employee could view.

Settings: This feature allows you to modify the information about yourself and your location, and also change your password to the system.</detailDescription>

<title>Contact Imports</title>
<description>This page lists contact imports and their status. An import may either be unprocessed, queued for processing, running, awaiting approval or approved.</description>
<features>
<featureDescription>An import goes though various stages before finally being approved and locked.</featureDescription>
<featureDescription>The first stage of an import is the unprocessed stage. In this stage, an import file in cvs format is uploaded to the application. In this stage the import is tagged as 'Import Pending.'</featureDescription>
<featureDescription>In the second stage, the unprocessed contacts file that was uploaded is queued to be processed. To do so, you need to map the various columns in the cvs file to the relevant contact fields(names, emails, telephones, etc) in the application. When the columns are mapped, the import is queued to be processed. Only one import is processed at a time, hence subsequent imports are queued until all previous imports are processed.</featureDescription>
<featureDescription>When an import is being processed (or running) the CRM application reads the cvs file, and creates contacts in the application. After the entire file is processed, the contacts are tagged as 'Pending approval'.</featureDescription>
<featureDescription>When the contacts are tagged as &amp;quot;Pending approval&amp;quot;,  you may examine whether the import worked as it was expected, and decide whether the imported contacts can be used for the due course of business. If you find that the mappings you specified were erroneous or insufficient, you may delete the import (which also deletes all contacts of the import) and create another one.</featureDescription>
<featureDescription>During the import process, some records in the cvs file may fail to import to the application. The failure is usually due to an incorrect specification of phone number, or very large names, etc. Such failed records are copied to an &amp;quot;error file&amp;quot; and available for you to examine. You may correct the information in the error file and run an import for this file alone, or you may add the records to the application manually.</featureDescription>
<featureDescription>When an import is approved, the contacts of this import are visible in the contacts list view and these contacts are ready to be used in the application.</featureDescription>
<featureDescription>When a import is approved, its results can only be viewed. The contacts of an approved import cannot be deleted en mass.</featureDescription>

<briefDescription>Pipeline helps in creating opportunities or leads in the company. Each opportunity helps to follow-up on a lead, which might eventually turn into a client. Here you can create an opportunity, search for an existing opportunity in the system, or export the data in different formats. The dashboard displays a progress chart in different views for all the employees working under the hierarchy of the owner of the opportunity.</briefDescription>
<detailDescription>This Pipeline System has four main features:

Dashboard: Gives you a quick, visual overview of opportunities.

Add: This page lets you add an opportunity into the system. Here a new opportunity can be added by giving the description of the opportunity. You can add a component that is associated with the opportunity. Each component can be assigned to an employee and the type of the component can be selected. For each component the probability of closing the component, the date estimated, the best guess for closing the deal and the duration for that component can be entered.

Search: You can search for an opportunity already existing in the system based on different filters.

Export: The data can be filtered, exported and displayed in different formats.</detailDescription>

<featureDescription>The general information section allows you to enter a service contract number, the start and end dates, the contract value, category, type, labor categories and free form description and billing notes.</featureDescription>
<featureDescription>The category and type of for service contacts are configured by your administrator to suit your business requirements. If you find, that a category or type required to describe the contract is not available in the list, please contract your manager of administrator to add the options. The options can be added using the administrator view.</featureDescription>
<featureDescription>The block hour information allows you to specify or adjust the hours associated with the contract.  The adjust link opens a pop up that allows you to enter hours credited or hours subtracted (preced with a '-' for negative numbers) a description and choose from a pre-configured list, the reason for the change. Again, if you do not find the required reason, please contact your manager or administrator to add the new option.</featureDescription>

<featureDescription>The service model options allow you to specify the terms of the service contract for various types of services (telephone, onsite, email or a general response time.) All the service model options are mandatory. If  one of the service model options is not relevant to the account, it is required to explicitly choose the option that specifies that this option is not not applicable. Hence, it is recommended that each of these lists be pre-configured with at least the &amp;quot;not applicable&amp;quot; option.</featureDescription>
<featureDescription>The select link in the labor categories field, allows multiple labor categories to be assigned to this service contract. The select link opens a pop up that displays labor category codes and a description of these codes. These labor category records were either setup during initial system installation or through the products module of this CRM application. If you require a labor category that is not available in the list view of the popup, you may add one using the catalog module if you have permission to add them, or contact your manager or administrator who has permissions to add labor categories using the catalog module.</featureDescription>

<description>The &amp;quot;Configure Permissions&amp;quot;  screen shows you a list of all permissions that can be adjusted in your project. Each tab is represented and has a variety of permissions that can be adjusted.&#13;
&#13;
For example, the first group is entitled,  Project Details,  which contains three permissions that can be adjusted:&#13;
1. View project details   defines which role(s) can view the project  Details  tab.&#13;
2. Modify project details   defines which role(s) can modify the information on the project  Details  tab.&#13;
3. Delete project   defines which role(s) can permanently delete this project&#13;
&#13;
The screen also allows you to define what members of your project can be allowed to view, add, change, or delete. Later on, when you add users to your project, you will need to know the answer to  what will each user be able to access in my project?</description>
<features>
<featureDescription>Users can be assigned one of the following roles, namely, Guest, Observer, Contributor and Project Lead. The Guest role is the least privileged role in a project and the Project Lead role is the most privileged role.</featureDescription>
<featureDescription>When a role is allowed a permission, the permission is also available to more privileged roles. For e.g., if a the permission &amp;quot;View project details&amp;quot; is allowed for the &amp;quot;Guest&amp;quot;, all superior roles namely, Observer, Contributor and Project Lead also inherit this permission. Similarly, if the &amp;quot;Modify Project Details&amp;quot; is assigned to &amp;quot;Project Lead&amp;quot; no other role inherits this privilege as the &amp;quot;Project Lead&amp;quot; role is the most superior (as in most privileged) role among preconfigured roles in the projects module.</featureDescription>

<featureDescription>This page contains the following fields</featureDescription>
<featureDescription>Status: Determines whether the article is shown when users view news articles; there are three possible choices: a) Draft if you are not finished with composing the article, choose Draft and you can finish the article later; even though you will see this article in your Current News list, other users will not unless they have access to to view Draft  articles b)Unapproved if you are finished, but would like the article to be approved before allowing others to view, choose Unapproved; even though you will see this article in your Current News list, others will not unless they have access to view Unapproved  articles c)Published indicates that the article is finished, approved, and ready to be seen by other users.</featureDescription>
<featureDescription>Position: Articles are typically displayed in the list by the most recent date first; if you would like certain articles to appear before others, no matter what their date is set to, then you can group them by position in which lower numbered articles always appear before higher numbered articles; by default 10 is used for all articles, so a number of 1-9 would appear before 10.</featureDescription>
<featureDescription>Start Date/Time: The specific date and time in which the article should be allowed to be viewed; prior to this time, only users who can see unreleased articles have access to this article; when the date/time occurs, the article will automatically be visible in Current News for the rest of the users in your project with access to the News Article list.</featureDescription>
<featureDescription>Archive Date/Time: The specific date and time in which the article should automatically be archived from the default view; users who have access to archived articles will be able to review these.</featureDescription>
<featureDescription>Subject: Each article needs a headline that gets displayed.</featureDescription>
<featureDescription>Intro: Each article can have an unlimited amount of text, however you might want to have an introduction to the article and require that the user choose to read any additional pages by selecting a  read more  link that appears when an article has an additional page.</featureDescription>
<featureDescription>Once you have finished your news article, and have completed the fields, choose to  Save  the article. If you would like to add an additional page to the article, choose  Save and Add a Page.</featureDescription>

This page shows you four (4) lists, some of which are empty. The right most list shows you the team members of your project. The left most list shows you ways in which you can add a team member.</description>
<features>
<featureDescription>Team members can be invited from: 1. Open projects   if you have existing projects, that are open, then you can begin by adding contacts from your open projects 2. Closed projects   if you have existing projects, that have been closed, then you can begin by adding contacts from a closed project 3. Email address   if the contact is not listed in one of your projects, then you can invite them by their email address.</featureDescription>
<featureDescription>The first list allows you to choose a method for inviting your contact. Depending on your choice, you will either be asked to choose a project in which to select a contact from, or you will be asked to input an email address. When you have selected a contact, make sure they show up in the right most list before continuing.</featureDescription>
<featureDescription>To remove a team member from your project, simply select them in the right column and they will be removed when the team is updated.</featureDescription>
<featureDescription>When you are finished modifying the team, choose  Update Team  to finalize the changes. If you added a contact by email address, and the CRM application is not familiar with that address, then you will be asked if you are certain you would like to invite them to the project. Choosing  Yes  will require that you input their first and last name.</featureDescription>
<featureDescription>When contacts are added to a project, whether they are users (have accounts) of CRM or not, each contact will be sent an email inviting them to your project.</featureDescription>
<featureDescription>When you return to the list of users, you can modify their role in the project by using the drop-down menu next to their name. As soon as the drop-down is changed, the system immediately updates the user's role.</featureDescription>
<featureDescription>All added team members are initially identified as  invited.  This means that you would like them to be on this project, but the contact will need to be informed of this action and asked to accept the invitation. If the contact does not have an account, then they will receive an email that allows them to easily obtain an account before accepting your invitation.</featureDescription>

<description>While news articles provide a formal way to announce and disseminate project happenings, discussion groups allow for more informal camaraderie and collaboration.&#13;
&#13;
Discussion groups are comprised of forums, topics and messages.&#13;
&#13;
Forums provide some sort of categorization among what is being discussed. For example, you might have forums for  Suggestions,   Status Reports  and  Resources.  Small projects might have just one forum, while larger projects may require multiple forums.&#13;
&#13;
Once a forum has been created, it's time to create a topic for discussion. A topic is simply a subject and a message. Forums can have multiple topics in which users can reply to and comment on.&#13;
&#13;
Once a topic has been posted, other team members can reply.</description>

<description>The Projects module comes with a sophisticated document management tool. You can use it to store versions of documents in a hierarchy of folders. When you select the  Documents  tab you are presented with a list of folders and files that belong to the project.&#13;
&#13;
To create a folder, select the  New Folder  link. To store a file, select the  Submit File  link. When uploading a file you can specify a subject for the file that gets displayed in the list. You can store documents at the top level, or you can navigate into any available folder and then store a file there.&#13;
&#13;
Once a file exists in the document library, you will see it appear in the list. By choosing the  Select  button next to the file, you are presented with several options,namely&#13;
&#13;
1. View File History:  Viewing the file's history shows the versions that exist for a file and how many times each version has been downloaded.&#13;
2. Download File:  This will begin downloading the file to your computer.&#13;
3. View File Contents:  The file will be displayed in a popup window; only certain types can be displayed, for example PDF, Excel, HTML, Text, and Word documents.&#13;
4. Rename File:  This will allow you to modify the subject of a file.&#13;
5. Add Version: This allows you to upload a new version to an existing document; the existing file will not be altered and can be downloaded or deleted separately; version numbers can be indicated as: (a) Major -  Generally a substantial amount of content has    been added or modified (b) Minor -  Generally some amount of content has been added or modified (c) Changes - Generally a small amount of content has been added or modified.&#13;
6. Move File:   This allows you to move the file to another folder.&#13;
7. Delete File:  This will delete the file and all versions of the file; to delete just a version of the file.&#13;
You can choose the  View File History  link for additional options</description>

<description>The plan tab is perhaps the most functionally rich feature of the projects module.&#13;
&#13;
Plans can be used for creating a high-level view of project milestones or objectives and then proceeding to low-level details.&#13;
&#13;
1. Start with an outline. Outlines can be used to organize objectives for the project. To create a new outline, click the  &amp;quot;New Outline&amp;quot; link. You are presented a number of fields that allow you to describe all the information for the outline.&#13;
&#13;
2. Detail the outline with activities and assignments.</description>
<features>
<featureDescription>This page lists all the project plans. Each item in the list provides a snapshot of the outline including the outline's start date, the start date, the description and status, the progress made in completing the items of the outline and the effort expended in completing the items of the outline.</featureDescription>
<featureDescription>Using the drop list as a filter you can choose to view only open outlines, only closed outlines or view all outlines.</featureDescription>
<featureDescription>When you click on the select option, you are presented with a choice view, edit or delete the outline.</featureDescription>

&#13;
a) Title  - a project milestone to be displayed.&#13;
b) Requested By -  The name of a person that may have initiated the reason for the milestone; could be the name of a client.&#13;
c) Department or Company - The organization that may have initiated the reason for the milestone; could be the name of a company.&#13;
d) Expected Dates - The date in which the milestone is expected to begin and the date in which the milestone is expected to be completed on.&#13;

&#13;
When you click on  the name of the outline, a drop-down menu appears with the option to &#13;
a) Add Activity Folder &#13;
b) Add Activity &#13;
&#13;
An Activity Folder allows you to create sections in your outline. This can be useful when you are building the outline and haven't yet decided how to group Activities.&#13;
&#13;
Activities are specific items to be completed toward this project objective or&#13;
milestone.&#13;
&#13;
Activities have several fields: &#13;
